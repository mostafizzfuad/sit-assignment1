    <h1>A Book Fair</h1>

    <div><span class="book">A book fair</span> is a special type of fair where books are the main attraction for all class of people. And the main thing about a book fair is not sale but display of books on different subjects by different writers. Now- a- days a book fair has become very popular. It has created a sense of interest for books amongst the general mass. Normally it is held in a field or premises. Recently I got an opportunity to visit a book fair. It was originated by Bangla Academy. Hundreds of pavilions were set up. There were a huge number of book on miscellaneous subject of different age. All sorts of books- fictions, text books, dramas, children books, reference books, novels etc were displayed. I purchased some books of my own choice. Some stalls were also found to sell snacks and cigarettes and thus to pollute the premises. I took some refreshment here. A book fair becomes crowdie especially in the evening. Both male and female customers gather at a book fair. The writers also visit the fair regularly. Seminars and cultural programmers are also held. A book fair reminds us that books are our best companions. They are always our sides when we are in danger. The change our outlook on life and widens our domain of knowledge. It is books which help us to forget jealousy, malice and superstition. Again we get these best friends at a cheaper rate from a book fair. Many novice writers can start their career from a book fair. It was a pleasant experience for me and I think a book fair is very important for the enlighten section of people. So, it should be organized more and more for the betterment of our future life.</div>

    <div>The fair is organized by <span class="bangla">Bangla Academy</span> in the premises of the institution. I went there with some of my friends. When I entered the main gate of the fair. I found a different environment. I saw all sorts of books such as fictions, text books, dramas, children books, reference books etc.</div>

    <div>Men, women and children of all ages and classes gathered there. The stall were occupied by different publisher. From a book stall, I bought some books. In the evening many poets, novelists and writers came to visit the fair.</div>

    <div>Various kinds of novels, poetical works and science fictions are mainly available in a book fair. A festive look prevails all around. The renowned artists, poets intellectuals gather there and take part in the seminars and cultural programmes.</div>

    <div>My personal Impression about a book fair is that it can play an important role in developing the habit of reading books among people. It is a device to spread culture, education and knowledge. It changes our outlook on life and widens our domain of learning.</div>
